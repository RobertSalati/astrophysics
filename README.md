# astrophysics
Astrophysics code used for my term project
Libraries required: Scipy, Numpy, matplotlib

This code solves the N body problem using scipy's ODEint function. To use, input the desired parameters at the top of the .py file and run the code. For an animation (2D only) type animation(sol) into the console. This may take a while.
